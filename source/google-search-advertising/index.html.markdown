##Website auditing - Where SEO starts

<img src="/images/website-auditing.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Logo design" class="alignright" />If we were the one to name this type of SEO service, we would name it “Web Inspection” so it’s a little more self explanatory. As it suggests, it’s a service that identifies all the issues that appear on your website which are not recommended by search engines & web authorities such as W3C or SEO professionals. 

If you’re really serious about the health factor of your website, there are endless fixes and optimisations you can do to make it more user friendly - yes we are not wrong, and the ultimate goal for web auditing is not search friendly but user friendly. If we look at the SEO pyramid, the end users are always at the top; everything else is just “do it to serve the end users better”. 

Once you have a better understanding of this, you will start to put yourself if the user’s shoes and think: “Whoa, there’re so many things I can do to make my website work better”, which is exactly how we feel every time we look at a new customer’s website. Leonardo da Vinci said “Arts are abandoned, never finished”, which is true but we like to think, we don’t abandon our arts - we design and build them, then we nourish them and make them user friendly.

##Online Marketing

At Weaving Weblets, no strategy begins without competitor research & client meetings - “You just cannot apply the same method you used before to a different client. Service without customisation is not a service”. That’s what we like to think. We spend time to research your industry, checking out the competition and evaluate what best digital strategies will work for you.

<img src="/images/online-marketing.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Logo design" class="alignleft" />On the other hand, we must listen to you, and learn about your business strengths, weaknesses, local competitors, profit margins, long term visions, and of course, your affordable budget. Therefore, if we offer our customers a marketing proposal, we want it to be practical. So practical that we can get it started right after you click the accept button. 

Online marketing is an ever changing industry, we want to be trendy but we don’t chase the algorithm nor take short cuts. We’ll never offer you something like “$500 for 5k links”. We would rather take advantage of the latest digital masterpiece to enhance your business. We want to build systems that generate revenue, automate your business process and cut down your running costs. 

We’re proud to say that, the main characteristic differentiating Weaving Weblets and it’s competitors is: we don’t just offer your online marketing services, we are interested in your businesses and care about your growth. It’s a mixture of respect, passion and perfectionism that drives us not to offer you what’s available on the shelf, but something tailored and strategised specially for you.

##Social Media Marketing

<img src="/images/social-media.jpg" width="200" height="auto" alt="Logo design" class="alignright" />If social media has the power to create political movements and change the way large corporations operate in third world countries because of cheap labor and poor working standards, imagine the power it harnesses. 

If executed correctly, social media marketing can generate more brand awareness than any other tool you could ever use, leading to an increase in website traffic and with a well designed site, generate leads or sales.

It is also important to communicate with your customers. If they are trying to reach out to you and having a hard time doing so, their experience will be a very poor one which could be devastating to your business after all the effort you put in to creating an amazing experience for your customer with your brand & products or services. Last thing you would want to do is have this tarnished because you missed out on listening to your customers through social outreach.
