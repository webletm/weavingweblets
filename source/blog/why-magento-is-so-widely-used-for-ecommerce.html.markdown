excerpt: I remember when growing up the most emphasised family value from my parents was Manners. Manners that shows you how to communicate with different age group, different background and different personality. In fact over the years out of all the family rules, not many have left in me nor seemed practical to me, yet manner is still on top of the list. The reason is simple – I used it all the time when dealing with people I knew little.

##A Brief History

The first Magento version released in early 2008 by a US company called Varien. It employed relational database MySQL, famous MVC platform Zend and EAV data model. Built in PHP, Magento inherits open source nature and quickly grown up to a widely adopted ecommerce architecture representing a third market share among most popular shopping cart solutions. Currently, Magento has both paid Magento Enterprise Edition (EE), and Free Magento Community Edition (CE). Unlike CE which is an open source free software mainly used by SMBs, EE is designed to accommodate large businesses which require additional feature and functionality. An annual maintenance fee will apply, in return it offers us technical support for installation and third party software integration.
