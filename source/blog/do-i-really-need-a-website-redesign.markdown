For a matter of reasons, a website redesign has become the end result of many companies’ online marketing review. Whether your old design looks date and failed to catch up the latest mobile trend, or your main business focus has shifted over the last five years and you need to redefine them, a website redesign is  one of the most applicable online marketing solutions to refresh your public image and lead your business to greater success.

However, website rebuild should not be your last resort nor to be used abusively – frequent redesign after redesign. If your online marketing falls into such pattern, then we suggestion you to review your whole online strategy rather than focus only on your website. Because it is very likely you have started it wrong.

First thing first, we need to understand the difference between building new website and redesigned website. A new website tend to focus more on your business side and less on functionality and user experience, simply because you don’t have any online users yet and you don’t know their behavior nor how to engage them. Therefore, focus more on presenting your business and highlight the value of your business is a good start.

On the other hand, the focus of a redesigned website should be shifted to emphasis more on user engagement, functionality, business automation, as well as strategised for the latest online marketing solutions. Accordingly, the traditional BA + Designer model will no longer deliver the maximum value of a website redesign. Instead, you need to invite SEO and PR.

Search specialists and Public Relation managers are the ones live and breath with your online visitors, and should be your valuable resource when considering rebuilding your website. To have the both involved in your redesign team is like build a super-charged factory car with the best aftermarket parts. Your website is optimised and strategised out of the box, which is not just more economic but also have much longer life span in today’s fast growth online industry.

The era of singular keyword search focused marketing has passed, and the era of user engagement marketing has began. Similar the numbers of fans and likes are far less important compare to previous SMM campaigns. The online marketing evolving from helping businesses find the right buyers to helping businesses better understand their buyers’ needs, which obviously should be reflected on your next website redesign.
