WordPress has been dominating open source web developing market for quite a few years now, with the amount of plugins built around it, more and more web developers are leaning towards adopting plugins rather than code their own modules. There’re even custom built WordPress themes which can get a website job done within days (which usually take weeks). As web developers we all aware the undeniable drawback of most plugins is security vulnerability. In other words, they attract hackers eye balls. Depends on the severity level of a website hacking, a website hacking is often lead to a website rebuild (regardless whether you can recover it from hacking or not).

So first thing first, how do we know a website is hacked? Here are a few signs just to name a few: (if you’re more tech-inclined here is a more <a href="http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/3-sneaky-tricks-hackers-use-to-target-wordpress-sites/" target="_blank">in-depth article about WordPress hacking</a>)

1) The most obvious one is the hackers tell you the site is compromised (usually a bad one).

2) Site speed suddenly dropped, a lot slower than usual.

3) Receiving complain emails from users regarding your website.

4) Search engine indexing is stuffed, spammy content is not visible in browsers but can be crawled by search engine bots (<a href="http://browseo.net/" target="_blank">test your website here</a>: browseo.net)

After the confirmation of website hacking, next step is to find out where these all started (however this is only for simply hacks, or a web rebuild is not an option for you). If you’re a developer, the first thing I would suggest to look at is Webmaster tool, which often tell you signs of website misbehave. If you can get a clue of the time stamp when hackers started to make their move, you then can go through your files to focus on suspected files correspond with the time stamp. Usually we need to go through a lot of files to dig out any strangers or compromised ones, this step can save you great time.

Once you locate all the hacked files, you can then start clean up process. Remove the files hackers uploaded to your server and replace all compromised files with the latest WordPress files. After you get you website back, things you need to do to prevent future hacking can be:

1) change your WordPress credentials, and use STRONG PASSWORD.

2) setup <a href="https://www.google.com.au/alerts" target="_blank">Google Alerts</a> to monitor your website.

2) update your WordPress and most importantly your plugins, if the hacking is due to an outdated plugin which is no longer supported by its developer, you will need to replace your plugin.

3) Check the content and functionality of your website, test all your forms. One particular page you need to look at is your 404 page, it’s a place favored by hackers as it often draws less attention than other pages.

4) If you website is built on a WordPress theme, ideally you should have used <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank">child theme</a> so that, your theme will also need to be updated.

In conclusion, keep your website up to date is the best way to avoid becoming a hacking victim. Check your hosting package and see if website updates are included, if not, it’s always worth to pay extra to have your website up to date. In terms of fixing website hacking, as mentioned above, for a small scale website, the most cost effective way is to rebuild your WordPress site. Once you get your hacked website back, you can export your content and media and import them to a fresh WordPress installation.
