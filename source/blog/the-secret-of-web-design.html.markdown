excerpt: I remember when growing up the most emphasised family value from my parents was Manners. Manners that shows you how to communicate with different age group, different background and different personality. In fact over the years out of all the family rules, not many have left in me nor seemed practical to me, yet manner is still on top of the list.

Aesthetics or Usability? Well, such a big question. First of all we have to say that we would love to have both, however in real cases they don’t work well together which means we have to sacrifice one to suit the other. It is almost close to art crafting when we try to make our design not just looks breathtaking but also user friendly and abundant in functionality. Difficult as it is, today’s design has become even more sophisticated when we started to introduce marketing elements. So much conflicts, where do we start with?

We realise things can be a lot easier if we think a few steps forward: what is a website made for? And the answer is, for most of our clients, their sites are design for either selling or promoting products/services. A noticeable problem about design is we have so many options to start with and we struggle with decisions. To simplify it, we always keep this in mind: a website is destined to sell, so our design must be crafted for that purpose.

As we start gather all the important aspects that makes a good selling websites, things like simplicity, engagement and site speed, our options become much lesser which does not only reduce the time needed to complete a project, but also minimise the risks of redesign (design is often the first thing to be blamed if the performance is poor).

From our point of view, the hidden truth about web design is that, many have focused too much on either aesthetics or usability, few has chosen to design a site from a marketing perspective. It doesn’t matter how good it looks or how many features it has, what it matters the most is that – will it help to generate leads or convert sales within each small window of visit session?
