Understanding Key Performance Indicators is by far the most valuable asset in harnessing online marketing for both digital marketers and business owners alike. In this series, we are introducing some of the most commonly used KPIs, explaining which stats they are related to, and how we can develop the right strategy by reviewing them correctly.

## Google Analytics KPIs

1.	__Visits/Sessions__: the number of times users visit a website during a set period of time. It includes new visitors who are visiting the website for the first time, and return users who have visited the site before.
2.	__Users__: the number of unique visitors who visit your website during a period of time. If a return visitor visits your website multiple times a day, he is only considered as one user and that’s why “Session” usually has a much bigger number than “Users”. As the number of users (also called website’s audience or online client base) contributes directly to acquisition, to increase the figure is often a priority for SEOs and social media marketers.
3.	__Pageviews__: the number of pages that are viewed by visitors in a period of time. This is a good indicator to show the quality of your website’s content, how well your website is integrally linked, and the usability (such its appearance on different devices).
4.	__Bounce Rate__: a percentage, calculated by dividing the number of people who visit only one page of your website by the overall number of visitors. A high bounce rate usually indicates either your content quality is low, or there is little relevance between your referrer and your pages.
5.	__Goals__: a desired action that happens on your website which directly (macro goals) or indirectly (micro goals) contributes to your sales. These include things like enquiries or phone calls. “Goals” is often interchangeable with another more commonly used SEO term – “Leads”.

##Google AdWords KPIs

1.	__Click Through Rate (CTR)__: an indicator of your ad performance and shows how appealing your ads are. It is calculated by dividing the number of times your ads are clicked by the total number of impressions (how many times your ads are shown). Good CTR may indicate that your ads are appealing (mentioning benefits such as deals and specials), up to date, creative, fulfilling the context of your market niche (such as use the right buzzwords); while a bad CTR tells you that your ad is outdated, boring or carries no incentives.
2.	__Cost Per Click (CPC)__: CPC is how much you have paid when one of your ads is clicked. Most people think CPC is very easy to understand as it sounds self-explanatory, and they think CPC is the price they are bidding on each keyword. In fact, that is NOT exactly right. As Google AdWords states, the cost per click you pay is: 0.01 + the next bidding price below your ad, which means it can be a lot less than your actual bidding price. As an example: you’re bidding on ‘bicycle services Sydney’ for $3.50, and your ad position is number 2. If number 3 is bidding at $1.80 for the same keyword, you will only pay $1.81 if your ad gets clicked, not $3.50. This is critical to understanding keyword bidding for AdWords.
3.	__Conversion/Conversion Rate__: once AdWords conversion tracking is correctly set up, it will generate a record in your Google AdWords under: Tools → Conversions each time a conversion happens (like visitors clicking your ads, going to your website, and generating a lead). It is one of the most important KPIs as it gives you an idea of whether your campaign is doing the right job or not. Conversion Rate on the other hand, tells you the effectiveness of your campaign. It is calculated by dividing the number of converted clicks by the overall number of clicks.
4.	__Cost Per Conversion__: the amount of money spent to generate one lead. When we talk about Cost Per Conversion, it is better to put it in the context of a real profit margin. For example, if the profit on a sale of a new bicycle is $400, and the profit for selling new bike wheel is $40, then a $40 Cost Per Conversion for the new bicycle campaign (assuming the acquisition rate is 60%) is profitable; however, the same Cost Per Conversion for the new bike wheels campaign (at the same acquisition rate) is not profitable.
5.	__Monthly Budget__: achieving effective budget control is like an artist creating a masterpiece. One of main difficulties is that your actual spend is often not the same as the daily budget you allocate – some campaigns may spend more than you expected, while others are quite the opposite. Therefore, a PPC Manager’s role is to keep the budget on track, and at the same time, maximise your conversions and maintain a reasonable Cost Per Conversion.
