##What is website auditing?

If we were the one to name this type of SEO service, we would rather name it “Website Inspection” so it’s self explanatory. As it suggests, it’s a service that identifies all the issues appeared on your website which are not recommended by search engine, web authority such as W3C or SEO professionals. If you’re really serious about the health factor of your website, there are endless fixes and optimisations you can do to make it more user friendly – yes we are not wrong, and the ultimate goal for web auditing is not search friendly but user friendly. If we look at the pyramid of SEO, end users are always sit on top; everything else is just “do something to serve the end users better”.

Once you have that kind of mentality, start to put your feet into the shoes of your end users, you will start to feel: “Wooh, there’re so much things I can do to make my website better”, which is exactly how we feel every time we look at a new customers website. Leonardo da Vinci said “Arts are abandoned, never finished”, which is true but for us, we don’t abandon our arts – we design and build them, then we nourish them and make them user friendly.

##Why is website auditing so important

You may have a well established business, or even the leader of your industry. You perfect your product and services, and train your employees to value your customer and carry your legacy. Whereas, your online presence may not reflecting the same standard.

You may get 100% satisfaction feedback from your regular local customers, yet you’re ignoring the damage you’ve made to the relationship of all your potential customers – your online visitors. “You just don’t care about them” – that’s how online visitors feel when they experience browsing headaches such as: broken links, poor search function or outdated information.
