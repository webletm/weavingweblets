##Logo Design

Your logo is a critical aspect of business marketing. It’s what your clients and competitors will familiarize themselves with and become the single most visible manifestation of the company within your market place. 

Your logo must be unique and comprehensible. At the end of the day, your logo is a representation of who you are and says a lot more about the company than you may think.

If you already have a logo and are not happy with it, we would love to have a chat with you about rebranding. They’re always cool projects.

The branding process is an extensive one however. Be aware that a proper branding process involves your attention a lot more than a $99 template logo from a printing company would. The return on investment though will speak for itself.

##Website Design

Designing a website is a funny game. In all cases, it doesn’t even start off with a designer. We have an extensive process of evaluating your companies:

*	Culture
*	Staff
*	Services
*	Products
*	Market
*	Competitors
*	And most importantly, your audience:
	*	Age
	*	Gender
	*	Etc

Once we have addressed exactly who and what the above is, we move on to the design phase using such techniques like persuasive design and psychology of design.

At the end of the day, a dull non functional website is useless. And no business is the same. So your website structure shouldn’t be either. Stay away from those templates!

##Print Design

After a fresh rebrand and stunning new website, you’re going to want to throw out those old school business cards and get some nice new business cards printed up on some really crafty paper.

You might also want to promote some of your new services with some visually appealing info graphics (Pamphlets). 

We can even get your company car done up in some branded vinyl wrapping. 

Whatever your printing requirement is, we can do the lot. Just let us know what you need and we can sort out the artwork and printing for you.
